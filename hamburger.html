    <p>“These are absolutely the best hamburger patties from start to finish,” raves hlippmann. “I had all the ingredients on hand and they grilled for 4 1/2 minutes each side! Delicious!!”</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Beef: These basic burgers start with 1 ½ pounds of lean ground beef. </li>
        <li>Onion: A finely chopped onion takes the flavor up a notch. </li>
        <li>Cheese: You’ll need shredded Colby Jack or Cheddar cheese. </li>


    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Combine the ingredients in a bowl. </li>
        <li>Make four patties. </li>
        <li>Grill the patties until the juices run clear and the meat is no longer pink in the center. </li>


    </ol>
